If you're focusing solely on a PWA without any native app wrapper, here's what you can do:

**1. Adding Voice Recording Feature:**

a. Use the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` method to record audio directly in the browser.

b. After recording, send the audio file to the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe it to text.

c. Display the returned text in the message input box of your app.

Here is an example of how you could implement voice recording in JavaScript:

```javascript
let mediaRecorder;
let audioChunks = [];

function startRecording() {
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true }).then((stream) => {
    mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
    mediaRecorder.start();

    mediaRecorder.addEventListener("dataavailable", (event) => {
      audioChunks.push(event.data);
    });

    mediaRecorder.addEventListener("stop", () => {
      const audioBlob = new Blob(audioChunks);
      audioChunks = []; // Reset chunks for the next recording

      // Send audioBlob to OpenAI's Whisper API and process the response
    });
  });
}

function stopRecording() {
  if (mediaRecorder) {
    mediaRecorder.stop();
  }
}
```

To integrate with OpenAI's Whisper API, you will need to send the audio data as a file, handle the HTTP response, and update your state to show the transcribed text in the message input box.

**2. Handling Audio File Sharing:**

Since you are dealing with a PWA, the process for handling shared audio files will depend on the capabilities current browsers provide. As of my last update, PWAs can register themselves as file handlers by specifying file extensions and MIME types in the web app manifest.

Here is a basic example of what the manifest file might include to handle audio files:

```json
{
  "name": "Your PWA",
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "share_target": {
    "action": "/",
    "method": "GET",
    "enctype": "multipart/form-data",
    "params": {
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "audioFile",
          "accept": ["audio/*"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in your PWA, you would need to handle incoming GET requests with an `audioFile` parameter in the URL.

Keep in mind that you'll want to check compatibility and follow updated specs for file handling in PWAs, as this information may evolve.

Both of these features are advanced topics and require detailed implementation that goes far beyond the scope of a simple explanation. Be sure to refer to the official documentation of React, PWAs, and the OpenAI API for the latest best practices and code examples.
